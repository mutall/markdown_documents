##### Quotations

Compare three different quotations from different vendors. For price evaluation and review. Learn how to (JN)

##### Proposal  

Write a proposal of the system for funding request. (DK)

##### Data collection  

Collect data for a month for effective review and learning how to manipulate data. (PK)

#### Camera systems

Resarch and present on how to use a camera system for the carpark. And also find out how the automated carparks operate by visiting three different carparks, how they are installed and implemented, also the modes of payment.(SW)  
How the gate control system works.
